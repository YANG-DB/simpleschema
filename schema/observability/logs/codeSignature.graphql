    # The hashing algorithm used to sign the process.

    # The identifier used to sign the process.

    # Additional information about the certificate status.
    # This is useful for logging cryptographic errors with the certificate validity or trust status. Leave unpopulated if the validity or trust of the certificate was unchecked.

    # Subject name of the code signer

    #Validating the trust of the certificate chain may be complicated, and this field should only be populated by tools that actively check the status.
    trusted:Boolean
    # Boolean to capture if the digital signature is verified against the binary content.
    # Leave unpopulated if a certificate was unchecked.
